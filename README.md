okay so this is what i made,
uses gemini API to generate quiz questions(yes,you will need to generate your own api key before running hahaha)....just by the topic you provide
(and yes i took help from chatgpt too)

also just wait a few seconds after you type in your topic for quiz to start
looking forward to your help in making it an actually workable project and learn from it!
